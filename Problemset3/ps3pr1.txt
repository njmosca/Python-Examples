1-4: I tried mystery (-1,9) and recived the following error from python tutor

Server error! Your code might have an INFINITE LOOP or be running for too long.
The server may also be OVERLOADED. Or you're behind a FIREWALL that blocks access.

RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in comparison
